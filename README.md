# Matrix-multiplication-using-Systolic-Arrays

Designed systolic array structure for matrix multiplication in IEEE floating point format using Verilog.
Designed Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) unit using floating point adder and multiplier.
Synthesized the MAC unit and systolic array structure on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA board.
